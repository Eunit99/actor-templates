## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-at-apify-console). In short, you will:

1. Build the Actor
2. Run the Actor

## Pull the Actor for local development

If you would like to develop locally, you can pull the existing Actor from Apify console using Apify CLI:

1. Install `apify-cli`

    **Using Homebrew**

    ```
    brew install apify/tap/apify-cli
    ```

    **Using NPM**

    ```
    npm -g install apify-cli
    ```

2. Pull the Actor by its unique `<ID>`. This command will copy the actor into the current directory on your local machine.

    ```
    apify pull <ID>
    ```
